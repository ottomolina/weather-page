# Web Weather

This is a web page that shows a weather from a place previously searched.

## Setup

If you don't installed [Angular](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local), you need to run the following command in order to install it:

```

If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine.

- Run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command to clone the files to your machine:

- Once the files are on your machine, open the weather-page in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, you can run the application in development mode running the following [Angular](https://angular.dev) command:
